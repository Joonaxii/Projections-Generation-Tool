# Projections-Generation-Tool
This is the tool I've made for generating "Projections" for my Terraria mod.
Uses my J-Core C++ framework thing as a base & includes it as a submodule.

# Notes
Note that this tool uses SSE2/3 functionality so it might not be supported by some VERY old CPUs. Most should work though.
